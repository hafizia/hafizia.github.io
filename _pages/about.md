About Me
===

Hi there! I'm Hafiz Indra Arwinata, an aspiring academic interested in cosmology and galaxies. I am mostly interested in gravitational lensing. I enjoy collaborating with other scientists, participating in conferences, and discussing concepts that expand our knowledge of the universe. Outside of academia, I like to watch anime and read manga. Please contact me if you want to talk about gravitational lensing or share your knowledge of the exciting science of cosmology!

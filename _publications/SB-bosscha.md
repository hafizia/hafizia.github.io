We conducted a continuous sky brightness monitoring project in 2023 using the 14-inch (f/7.2) Bosscha Robotic Telescope (BRT) with Bessel filters at Bosscha Observatory. We present the initial measurement result of the extinction coefficient and sky brightness of three photometric nights from July to September 2023 using absolute photometry methods on photometric standard stars. We obtained mean V-band-pass brightness of 18.807 ± 0.061, 18.999 ± 0.052, and 18.867 ± 0.039, respectively, with a color index B − V of 0.421 ± 0.111, 0.236 ± 0.094 and 0.426 ± 0.064. The results are consistent with measurements from the transformed Sky Quality Meter (SQM) corresponding to the suitable filters.

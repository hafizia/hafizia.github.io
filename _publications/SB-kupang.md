A remote telescope system has been established at Universitas Nusa Cendana, Kupang. Bosscha Observatory, Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB), and the Physics Study Program at Universitas Nusa Cendana (Undana) collaborated to develop the system. The ITB-Undana Telescope system has a QSI 616 CCD camera and BV RI Bessel filter attached to a 20-cm (f/10) Schmidt-Cassegrain reflector. Several research and public outreach activities have been conducted using the ITB-Undana remote telescope throughout 2023. When establishing a new astronomical observation site, it is imperative to conduct sky characterization and quality assessment. This process involves measuring night sky brightness and atmospheric extinction coefficients. In May 2023, we observed photometric standard stars using the absolute photometry technique with BVRI Bessel filters. We obtain a value of mean sky brightness value in V bandpass, V = 19.431 ± 0.022, with color index (B − V) = 0.492 ± 0.039. These night sky brightness values are suitable for measurements using the SQM.
